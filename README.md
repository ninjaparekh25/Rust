## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to **learning Rust**.  
Here, I will be experimenting with Rust code, documenting my progress, and practicing key concepts of the language.

## 🦀 Why Rust?

Rust is known for:
- ✅ **Memory Safety** without a garbage collector  
- ✅ **High Performance** comparable to C/C++  
- ✅ **Zero-cost Abstractions**  
- ✅ **Fearless Concurrency**  
- ✅ **Strong Type System**  

Rust is used for **systems programming, web servers, blockchain, operating systems, and CLI tools**.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand **ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes**  
- Practice **error handling** and **pattern matching**  
- Explore **Cargo** and the Rust ecosystem  
- Write **safe and efficient** system-level programs  
- Build small projects (CLI tools, web apps, etc.)  

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To install Rust, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
```Verify installation:
rustc --version
```
OR
```Create a new Rust project:
cargo new hello_rust
cd hello_rust
cargo run
```
```🚀 Example Code
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rustaceans! 🦀🚀");
}
```
